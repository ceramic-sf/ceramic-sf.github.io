Scott Alexander introduces the concept of Moloch to represent
coordination failure.

See his blog post Meditations on Moloch ([https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)).

The idea is rich and poetic, but is it a good one?
It has certainly captured the attention of many, who now
seek to view the world anew through the lens of coordination failure.

Does this horn-rimmed lens prevent a better view on reality?

I argue that the Moloch framework has some problems.

### Dissection

This is just an overview.

See [a dissection of Moloch](/2023/10/24/quick-boi.html/#a-dissection-of-moloch---ceramic-exploration)
for a more detailed look. This has been added as an extension to the exploration of the Beginning
of Infinity because it builds on some ideas there.

It includes concept diagrams and an examination of the 14 examples that appear in the
original Moloch blog post.

### Coordination is just one solution among many

Consider the problem of not enough energy. What is the cause of that problem? We do not have fusion reactors, which would solve that problem.

Should we say that the energy problem is caused by
- "fusion reactor failure"? or
- More energy use than energy production.

"Coordination failure" (aka Moloch) is the same as "fusion reactor failure". It is a counterfactual solution. It is something that could have happened but did not. Many things could have happened but did not.

If one wants to explain why something happened, there is usually
an explanation in terms of things that really did happen.

A fusion reactor is one solution to some problem, but there exist other solutions. Many of those may be easier to achieve. Calling an energy
shortage "fusion reactor failure", implies that other energy solutions
are not valid. Anyone trying to solve the problem is implicitly directed to think about fusion-related concepts at the exclusion of other ideas that could solve the problem better.

Moloch is a lens that makes one forget about all solutions except coordination.

### Multi-agent problems will always have a coordination solution

When multiple competing parties are involved, one can always imagine some creative solution where they cooperate. This does not mean that the solution is always coordination. It is a mistake to imagine that coordination is always missing.

This is important because of the myriad of ways a problem could be solved,
coordination may actually be one of the hardest to achieve.

If we train our minds to always look for Moloch, we may be training ourselves to avoid creating other solutions that do not involve coordination.

### Moloch, rewritten


```md
Moloch! Moloch, whose fog of fear distracts! Moloch, whose binary mind boils and scratches at the joy of possibility.

A problem of Moloch, whose weak foundations of despair unravel. Moloch, whose haunted mirror claim is lost in the battle trample of ideas.

Moloch whose unseen hands turn unseeable cogs! Oh Moloch! Moloch! A birthmark of doom that never was.
```

There is no Moloch, no single missing cog of coordination in every problem. No limit to what ideas
can be created to multi-agent problems.

The Ginsberg poem, recast with the reality that problems are inevitable, but soluble.
```

Can we coordinate?

We can do so much more. Coordination is but one idea in the infinite sea of ideas.

When you see multiple parties competing and causing an undesired outcome, do not imagine
coordination failure. Imagine all the crazy and interesting ways the situation could change.
